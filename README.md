# keepass-icons
A collection of icons from popular services or softwares, optimized for use in KeePass and similar apps.

## examples

## description
The collection currently has more than 200 icons. All icons are in PNG format, optimized for the smallest possible file size, keeping original visual and colors or with imperceptible changes if this contributes to reduce the file size. As a result, your password databases will grow little using these icons.

## about sizes
| dimensions | file size | status | comment                                                                                    |
|:----------:|:---------:|:------:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|    16x16   |   ~380 B  |  base  | Recomended for PC versions of KeePass. Smallest file size and may look ugly on smartphone. |
|    32x32   |   ~600 B  |  100%  | It presents a good visual gain on smartphones, without increasing too much the file size.  |
|    48x48   |     ?     | maybe? | I'm still analyzing if it's worth the effort for this dimension.                           |
|    64x64   |     ?     |   0%   | Planned. Beautiful on lowend smartphones without requiring so much processing power.       |
|   128x128  |     ?     |   0%   | Planned. Extremely beautiful on highend smartphones but larger file sizes per icon.        |

KeePass PC versions display the icons in 16x16 pixels, so this small size is perfect if you use your password database exclusively on PC or notebooks. In that case using larger sizes is a waste of resources. However 16x16 icons don't look nice on smartphones because of the way the touch interaction is built, displaying everything in larger sizes. If you use your database exclusively on smartphones and want a nice view of the icons, try using one of the collections with larger dimensions, but don't forget that this will increase your database size, especially if you have many passwords. The higher the quality, the larger the file sizes. If you use your databases interchangeably or sync between PC/mobile, and prefer to balance between beauty and size, use one of the "mid-sized" collections. On the other hand, KeePass is an amazing software and can handle such large images. Anyway, it's a personal choice, considering the visual quality, your smartphone's specifications, your internet bandwidth, which KeePass fork are you using.

## missing icons
If you can't find icons for popular services or software that you use, open an issue or contact me and I'll be happy to add these icons to the collection. Please note that this collection is based on 16x16 icons, so some icons are not yet available in larger dimensions.

## why some different icons?
Some icons may differ in different dimensions. Images with larger dimensions can display more information, and can even include the company name along with the logo. The 16x16 icons are extremely limited in what they can display and most are based on the favicon provided by the company itself.

## updated icons
From time to time companies change their icons. In case I notice, I'll update them in the collection and make tags. If you still prefer to use the old icons, you can download a zip from these older releases. To get the most up to date versions of the icons, download the main repository as a zip file.

## boring info
Initially I organized this collection for personal use, but I decided to make it available to save other people's time. Please note that I do not own the rights to the images, the rights are reserved to the respective companies, so the collection is restricted to personal and non-profit use only. If you or your company owns the rights to any of these images and you do not agree with this fair use, let me know. I will be happy to remove it from this collection.
