# keepass-icons
A collection of 16x16 pixels icons, for use in KeePass and similar software.

## description
The collection currently has more than 200 icons, with an average size of just 400 bytes per icon in the 16x16 dimensions. All icons are in PNG format, optimized for the smallest possible file size, keeping original visual and colors or with imperceptible changes if this contributes to reduce the file size. As a result, your password databases will grow very little using these icons.

## future plans
The small 16x16 icons are perfect to use in KeePass PC versions, however they don't look great on smartphones, because of the high definition on their screens. So I plan to publish the icons in larger sizes, starting with 32x32 and in the future maybe 48x48, 64x64 and 128x128, however this will greatly increase the size of the database and is only favorable for those who use KeePass mainly on mobile phones. Let me know if you are one of those people.

If you can't find icons for popular services or software that you use, open an issue or contact me, reporting the url of the site or software, and I'll be happy to add these icons to the collection.

From time to time companies change their icons. In case I notice, I'll update them in the collection and make tags. If you still prefer to use the old icons, you can download a zip from older tags.

## boring info
Initially I organized this collection for personal use, but I decided to make it available to save other people's time. Please note that I do not own the rights to the images, the rights are reserved to the respective companies, so the collection is restricted to personal and non-profit use only. If you or your company owns the rights to any of these images and you do not agree with this fair use, let me know. I will be happy to remove it from this collection.
