# keepass-icons
A collection of icons from popular services or apps, optimized for use in KeePass and similar software.

## examples

## description
The collection currently has more than 280 icons. All icons are in PNG format, optimized for the smallest possible file size, keeping original visual and colors or with imperceptible changes if this contributes to reduce the file size. As a result, your password databases will grow little using these icons.

## about sizes
| dimensions | file size | status | comment                                                             |
|:----------:|:---------:|:------:|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
|    16x16   |   ~370 B  |updated | Smallest file size. Recomended for use with PC versions of KeePass. |
|    32x32   |   ~740 B  |updated | Some visual gain on smartphones, without increasing size too much.  |
|    64x64   |  ~1170 B  |216/283 | Looks good on low-end smartphones without requiring so much power.  |
|   128x128  |  ~2270 B  |216/283 | Extremely beautiful on high-end smartphones, but larger file sizes. |

KeePass PC versions show icons in 16x16 pixels, which is great for PC or notebook use. However, these small icons may don't look good on smartphones because of the higher DPI and larger UI elements. If you use KeePass on a smartphone and want better looking icons, select icons with larger dimensions, but keep in mind that this will increase your database size.

## missing icons
If you can't find icons for services or software that you use, open an issue or contact me and I'll be happy to add these icons to the collection.

## why some different icons?
Some icons may differ in larger dimensions. They display more information, and can even include the company name along with the logo. The 16x16 icons are limited in what they can display and most are improved versions of the company-supplied favicon.

## updated icons
From time to time companies change their icons or logos. In case I notice, I'll update them in the collection and make tags every year. If you still prefer to use the old icons, you can download a zip from these older releases. To get the most up to date versions of the icons, download the main repository as a zip file.

## boring info
Initially I organized this collection for personal use, but I decided to make it available to save other people's time. Some images are generic enough to be ineligible for copyright, and others are very specific and were based on the company's logos, with the rights reserved by the respective companies and protected as a trademark in some jurisdictions, so this collection is restricted to personal use only. If you wish to publish some of these images in any way, even non-profit, please contact the company to verify the legality and obtain greater fidelity images, you agree that you are responsible for this. If you or your company owns the rights of any of these images and do not agree with this fair use, please let me know and I will be happy to remove it from this collection.
